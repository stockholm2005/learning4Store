        Integrated Apple's verification code for "In-App Purchase Receipt Validation on iOS" and
        refactored verifyReceipt API to accommodate improvements.

        Added a new module property: receiptVerificationSharedSecret (used by the 'verifyReceipt' method)
        Updated the example to support receipt verification (new switch on the UI and new code on the callback method to call 'verifyReceipt' for each transaction)
        Updated the documentation to reflect the changes
        DEPRECATED the 'callback', 'sandbox', and 'sharedSecret' properties of the dictionary object passed to the 'verifyReceipt' method
        Added new 'callback' parameter to the 'verifyReceipt' method
        Added additional properties to the dictionary object returned for purchased and restored transactions for consistency and use in passing to 'verifyReceipt'</p>
